![leftquote]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/leftquote.png)It has been an amazing year, full of blessings, heartbreak, love and noise.  Always lots and lots of noise!  As we reflect back on the miracle and beauty of our family, we are slowly realizing God’s direction in our lives.  He has given us a great passion (and often huge heartbreak) for His children in need.  And one of the ways we enjoy living out this passion is through our work at the [Lifesong for Orphan’s schools in Ethiopia](http://www.lifesongfororphans.org/ethiopia-high-school/ "Lifesong Ziway Adami Tulu").  I (Shonda) just returned from Ethiopia a few weeks ago and I had the opportunity to visit with many of the students at the schools and in their homes.

One of those living, breathing heartbreaks comes in the shape of a 9<sup>th</sup> grade boy named Mesfin ([see his story here](http://vimeo.com/111152619)).  He was one of our eighth graders from last year who passed his 9<sup>th</sup> grade exams (a HUGE accomplishment).  Unfortunately, Lifesong currently has no high school, and so Mesfin and his class mates could no longer attend the Lifesong schools.  As I visited with Mesfin and his mother, I could feel and see their despair.  He said what he wanted more than anything else was to return to the loving, nurturing, Christ-teaching school to finish his education.  At that moment, I felt God impressing upon my heart that our family should get involved.![snowflake1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/snowflake1.png)

And so here we are again this Christmas season with our hearts and eyes fully focused on His work in Ethiopia … to come alongside Lifesong and work towards breaking ground on a high school for Mesfin, his class mates and all of “our” beautiful ZAT children that will follow.  And the really good news is that we are almost there … in fact 75% of the way there.

![family2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/family2-300x242.jpg)Our goal as a family is to raise $20,000, the approximate cost of one high school classroom.  Last Christmas, we quite literally had the best Christmas our family has ever experienced and we were overjoyed to see so many of our friends and family join us in Lifesong’s mission in Ethiopia. This year, we hope you’ll join us again on the next leg of this journey. **We will personally match all donations up to $10,000**.  And here’s the really, really good news.  Lifesong has an anonymous donor who will then match our donations, so **your donation will be quadrupled**.  If you give $100 it will become $400.  If you give $1000 it will become $4000.  And our family’s goal of $20,000 becomes $40,000 and one classroom becomes TWO!!!

Thank you SO much for being a part of our lives and for your prayers and support.  While it is difficult to ask for money, we realize what a blessing it is to give, and wow are these kids worth it!

**All our Love & Gratitude,**

Donation checks can be made payable to Lifesong for Orphans using the enclosed, stamped envelope, or online donations can be made at [www.acharityproject.com/f/DietzChristmas](http://www.acharityproject.com/f/DietzChristmas).

p.s., We are all (Travis, Shonda, Lyla, Timothy, Biruk, Anna & Joseph) traveling to Ethiopia for two weeks in March to see the Lifesong Schools.  We are so excited to visit Mesfin and the rest of the students and hopefully see first-hand the construction of this high school.  We apologize in advance for the inundation of photos & updates :-)
