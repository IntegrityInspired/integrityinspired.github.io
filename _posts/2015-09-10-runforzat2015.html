<p>It’s that time again! Lace up those shoes and get ready to run. This is the 3<sup>rd</sup> annual Team ZAT Kansas City Marathon sponsored by Integrity Inspired Solutions. Ever been told that kids can't change the world?  Here's your chance to prove that theory wrong, all the while getting fit and having fun.  Kids grade K through 8th now have the opportunity to run the Kansas City Marathon for Team ZAT and raise money for kids in need in Ethiopia.</p>
<p><u>26.2 miles?  What?</u><br />
It's easier than it sounds.  Kids are encouraged to track 25 "miles" of activity leading up to race day. This can include running, biking, swimming, playing soccer, playing tag, etc.  Then on October 17th you get to finish the last 1.2 miles of the official Kansas City Marathon and cross the finish line with your friends.</p>
<p><u>Cost?</u><br />
It's <strong>free</strong> for all participants.  In order to receive your official Team ZAT (amazingly stylish) shirt, we simply ask that you raise at least $19 in (tax deductible) donations benefiting Lifesong for Orphans Ethiopia (<a href="http://www.zatproject.com/sponsor-a-child/?unsponsored=1" target="_blank">enough to sponsor one child for one month</a>).</p>
<p><u>Fundraising?</u><br />
Is simple.  Once you are registered, your Team ZAT coach will create your own personalized fundraising page that you can share with friends and family.</p>
<p><u>Da Goods?</u><br />
No fun race is complete without prizes, and KC Kids Marathon is no different.  Every participant will receive an official race medal, a Kansas City Marathon shirt and a Team ZAT shirt.  There is also fun activities and entertainment for the whole family the day of the race.</p>
<p><u>Where and When?</u><br />
Race starts at 9:30 AM at Crown Center.  For more information on parking, location, times, and other races, <a href="http://www.sportkc.org/marathon/register/kids-marathon/" target="_blank">click here</a>.  Plan to stick around for the Kids Zone until 11:00.</p>

<p>Ethiopia is the second home of my wife and I and we’re excited to partner with Lifesong’s work there in country. As one who has held these little ones in his arms and who has seen the impact of the work being done in Ethiopia, you have my personal guarantee that this work is worth your investment of time and any other resources you choose to pour in.</p>
<p>In 2015, our family visited Ethiopia to visit the schools in Ziway and Adami Tulu (amongst other things). That trip deepened our love and passion for this ministry and the community that we are pouring the love of Christ into. There is a beautiful child behind every dollar raised and given.  (Check out some of our pics at the end of this post.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lifesongfororphans.org/" target="_blank">Lifesong for Orphans</a> is the organization that sponsors the school and child sponsorship program that this run is for. “Solving the global orphan crisis won't happen tomorrow, but food, spiritual mentoring and a world-class education are powerful solutions.” This is what it’s all about. Lifesong has been blessed with partners who underwrite all US administrative and fundraising costs (TMG Foundation and other partners). 100% of your donation received by Lifesong will go directly to the need…helping orphans. - See more at: <a href="http://www.lifesongfororphans.org/give/donate" target="_blank">http://www.lifesongfororphans.org/give/donate</a></p>
